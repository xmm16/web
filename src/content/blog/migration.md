## Why?

After many months of brainstorming and researching, I've decided to migrate to Astro to make my website better. This would also work as a portfolio and making a pretty portfolio is pretty worth it, Astro's web framework allows me to use syntax highlighting whenever I show code and things like that so it will come handy for the following posts.

## Conclusion

Be prepared to see a LOT of blogs! I'm also setting up a RSS feed for anyone who is interested on it.
