# Why?

After many months of brainstorming and researching, I've decided to migrate to Astro to make my website better. This would also work as a portfolio and making a pretty portfolio is pretty worth it.

And now I can technically do proper blogs with...

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Syntax Highlighting!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

# Conclusion

Be prepared to see a LOT of blogs! I'm also setting up a RSS feed for anyone who is interested on it.
